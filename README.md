# Ateroids_Train
## Ryan Walt, Sam Carson, Keith Schmitt

This project was examining how we could use NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train an agent to play Asteroids. We built our own library of NEAT functions and methods in java and then connected that to a game of Asteroids that was also written in java.
